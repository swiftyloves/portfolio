            <p class="content">At first, our client had ambiguous concept on what they want to do to support community. They only got rough ideas that should be technology related. We had discuss back and forth, inside and outside the team.  I learnt that how to communicate to scope the problem and made everyone on the same page. After finalizing the scope, we needed to examine the support our client provided us.</p>

            <p class="content">A thorough background research matters. The background research helped me understand the topic deeply, and thus added me to come out appropriate questions we would like to explore from the interviewees. I learnt that conducting complete background research was significant because the questions you designed would affect what you could get from the interviewees. </p>

            <p class="content">I also learnt that how to sort the interview notes and filtered the useful information. During the process of building affinity diagram, I learnt how to cooperate with the team to organize information, analyze data as well as brainstorm to develop design ideas. On writing reports, I learnt how to complete your recommendation with the background research, the findings and the design ideas. We needed to find more existing examples and resources regarding to our recommendations to provide our client more actionable items. When presetting, I learnt how to organize and articulate what we did with limited time.
