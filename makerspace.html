                In general, a makerspace could be a physical place fea- tured many visible technology equipments and tools and in- visible functions. Practically, people can learn how to do-it- yourself, make hands-on creation, practice skills, and grow from mistakes.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Although it is obvious on the practical and physical ap- pearance, makerspaces are not defined by some specific ma- terials or spaces. It is more about a set of community part- nerships, collaboration, sharing, learning, and creation. Peo- ple making and creating in makerspaces are called makers. The maker sprit is more like taking risks, trying things they never experienced before, and willing to fail again and again. Makerspaces could regarded as the informal sites for creative production.

Being a supporter to their community, the library is still looking to expand and wants to provide more valuable service to the community. At this moment, they’re thinking about holding STEAM-oriented or any other relevant programs to support their community, such as a makerspace. In this project we focus on what might be the challenges that the library would confront in constructing a maker space. </p>

Then we did background research to fully understand the background of our client and the environment of the the library. Based on our background research, we created our interview protocol. We also examined the interviewees’ work roles and discussed with the client to change some the interviewees to better gather insights from the data. We conducted 4 interviews and 1 context observations and run interpretation sessions to create annotated notes, which were used to build our affinity diagram, or affinity wall. From the wall walk, we analyzed data and did brainstorming to come out the design ideas. Synthesizing the findings, we did more research to complete our recommendations. </p>

            <p class="content">Our team did background research on the topics: exploration of makerspaces in libraries, the targeted communities, the emerging trends in library services, and marketing plan in libraries. The background research provided our team supplemental information to understand the context deeply and inspired us for final solutions. I was responsible for researching the makerspaces in libraries. In the research, I investigated three questions:
            <ul>
                <li>Why might libraries be suitable for makerspace? What are the existing makerspaces in libraries? What do they provide?</li>
                <li>What might people from different situation/background want from a maker space?</li>
                <li>What might be some of the challenges or concerns if the library were to follow through with a maker space?</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="content">
            Using high-quality sources such as LISA(Library and Information Science Abstracts) and ALA (American Library Association), I looked up 22 papers and online articles and synthesized the information to form an organized report. It is challenging to organize a large amount of  information. I did thorough research and helped our team to outline the interview protocol.

            <p class="content">After the initial kick-off meeting, we started our “contextual inquiry”, which includes conducting in-person interviews with one person at a time in their workplace and gathering data through observation and questioning with as little interference as possible. We interviewed four individuals, including two staff members in library and two library patrons. These interviews lasted from 60 to 90 minutes and took place in the library between the dates of October 25 and October 30, 2016. With interviews of both internal employees and external patrons, our team was able to hear from different perspectives and understand the situation in a comprehensive view. In addition, since most of our interviews were conducted during the daytime, we visited the library in the evening to observe the environment, activities and people’s behaviors and interactions so as to gain more understanding of the daily use of the library.

            <p class="content">We interpreted the interview notes and annotated them for further analysis. Then we put “annotated notes” on Post-It notes and produced an “Affinity Diagram” by sorting related content and clustering them into several groups for easier management and analysis. We identified five major themes:
            <ul>
            <li>Current Time and Training Challenges for Staff </li>
            <li>Technology Needs and Requirements in a Makerspace </li>

            <p class="content">Based on the findings and the background research, we made recommendations to direct the library on the possible creation of a makerspace. When necessary, we provided examples of other libraries and organizations that have followed these steps as well. These recommendations consist of:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Scoping the Initial Makerspace Services, which includes selecting a target audience, surveying that audience, prioritizing critical technology and services, and considering motivations for makerspace usage </li>

            <li>Financing New Services, which includes looking towards support from partnerships, grants, and sponsorships </li>

            <li>Consulting Community Experts, which includes creating an advisory board, contacting local makerspaces for training, and connecting with online maker communities </li>

            <li>Fulfilling Additional Makerspace Time Responsibilities, which includes redefining staff responsibilities, recruiting staff and volunteers, and providing instruction alongside equipment </li>

            <p class="content">In summary, while the library has the innovative capabilities and community relationships to create a successful makerspace, significant challenges remain for its implementation. The library should strive to address the complexities that each challenge represents. The issues of personnel management and resource limitation as well as user needs and community collaboration must figure prominently in discussions about how to construct a makerspace. The recommendations outlined herein provide a starting point for thoughtfully developing a library makerspace with key considerations in mind. Paying attention to details like workflow distribution ensures that no single staff member feels overburdened with the makerspace-related tasks assigned to them. Collaborating with STEAM school clubs and local maker organizations creates partnerships that sustain the space and community being constructed. Surveying community needs through unconventional methods like online forums and specialized questionnaires means no voices are left out of the process. Although the facets of implementing a makerspace are different, time-consuming, and difficult, the library would be well-equipped to meeting these challenges if it makes the proper investments.

            <p class="content">At first, our client had ambiguous concept on what they want to do to support community. They only got rough ideas that should be technology related. We had discuss back and forth, inside and outside the team.  I learnt that how to communicate to scope the problem and made everyone on the same page. After finalizing the scope, we needed to examine the support our client provided us.</p>

            <p class="content">A thorough background research matters. The background research helped me understand the topic deeply, and thus added me to come out appropriate questions we would like to explore from the interviewees. I learnt that conducting complete background research was significant because the questions you designed would affect what you could get from the interviewees. </p>

            <p class="content">I also learnt that how to sort the interview notes and filtered the useful information. During the process of building affinity diagram, I learnt how to cooperate with the team to organize information, analyze data as well as brainstorm to develop design ideas. On writing reports, I learnt how to complete your recommendation with the background research, the findings and the design ideas. We needed to find more existing examples and resources regarding to our recommendations to provide our client more actionable items. When presetting, I learnt how to organize and articulate what we did with limited time.
