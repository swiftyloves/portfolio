                Our team designed the mobile app Ceremony for our client, Tom Meloche. Tom is currently writing a book, Ceremony, which he hopes will improve productivity in the workplace. He will be consulting companies on his book and wanted to build a companion app to help companies implement the book's teachings. He contracted our team to create an interactive prototype to hand off to his developer. The app is expected in the Apple and Android app stores this Spring.

                The goal of the app is to empower employees to rate the success of reoccurring meetings ("ceremonies") at work. The app then provides data that will help organization's improve their meetings productivity.

            We conducted a user study, in which we interviewed <strong>8 people</strong> about their meeting experiences. The interviewees work in a wide range of industries including academic, religious, financial, construction, co-op housing, consulting, and technology. We created an interview protocol and modified it slightly according to  different work roles. We intended to discover the common problems among many different situation meetings and to understand the problems throughly.

After the meeting the participants would receive notification and take the survey. The host could see the statistic result after the survey.

                We took a parallel prototyping approach to our design. As a team we discussed and decided the required functions of the application according to both our findings and the client’s requirements. Then every designer worked on the wireframes, designing the features of the application according to their thoughts. We then came together and provided feedback.

                From our affinity wall, we realized the importance of separating roles (i.e. hosts v.s. participants) and how they may use this app differently. However, we wanted to keep one interface for all roles. Hence, we outlined the different ways a user will interact with the app based on their role using a system map. This helped us create our product requirements.

After a meeting ends everyone will receive a push notification asking for feedback about the meeting. Everyone will provide their anonymous feedback and then analyze the data.

That is, how to connect my design with other pages my team members are responsible. </p>

            <p class="content">I decided to tried and design all steps and came out that placing all steps of creating a ceremony in one page would be simpler and easier for users.

        <p class="content"> From our user tests we learned this was the most important part of the user flow. We had to make this as quick and as easy as possible or else users would not respond to the survey prompt. Imagine if you have 10 meetings a week in the app and if each survey takes 5 minutes to complete. That's almost an hour spent every week responding to surveys. People don't have time for that. So we simplified the three questions our client outlined into one overarching "How did the ceremony go?". </p>

        <p class="content">A user just needs to tap a smiley button and they are done. However, to allow for more qualitative responses we added attribute buttons that are optional along with an optional comments field. The attributes can be customized. We used our affinity wall findings to create the stock buttons content.</p>

The purpose of the application is to receive feedbacks on how to make the ceremony getting better and to encourage participants to state their opinions.

                The final pitch was very successful! Our client was very glad our team ended up still doing the user research and created something (even though slightly different than his original sketches) that could carry weight and adhere to user needs. It was a great learning experience for my personal communications skills: working with four other designs and trying to reaching consensus as well as managing client interactions.

                The challenge for me was to communicate with other designers as well as defended my opinions. The leading style of our team lead is pretty casual. He coordinated the team with  everyone’s opinions. Sometimes that would result in a little chaos. Gradually I learnt that if I felt something was important I should just bring it out or even volunteer on doing it. In the process I felt data visualization should be done although we did have enough time. Thus I volunteered to work on it and brought more than my team members expected. I also learnt that there is no standard way to work on a project. We could elaborate as much details as we want but we still need to considerate the limit time resource.
